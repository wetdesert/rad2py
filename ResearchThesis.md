# Introduction #

This project is part of my research [thesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis) corresponding to my system-analisys licenciate academic degree ([The University of Morón](http://www.unimoron.edu.ar/Home/InfoEnglish/tabid/296/Default.aspx), faculty of informatics - Argentina). This is my final work equivalent to writings presented in fulfillment of 4-years [undergraduate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undergraduate) coursework requirements in other countries.

Currently (2013), I'm studying for a [Master's Degree Programme on Free Software](http://www.uoc.edu/studies/mof/free_software/oficiales/master_oficial_software_libre/master_oficial_software_libre_plan.htm) ([Open University of Catalonia](http://www.uoc.edu/portal/en/index.html)), where I plan to extend the initial research as my Master's Thesis (est. 2014-2015 academic year).

They are in Spanish, until it get translated, I'm writing down some quotes used as references.

## Quotes ##


Steve McConnell. 1996. Rapid Development: Taming Wild Software Schedules (1st ed.). Microsoft Press, Redmond, WA, USA:

> In a 17-year study involving more than 100 experiments with live projects
> and 50 technologies, NASA's Software Engineering Laboratory concluded that
> improvements are characterized by continual, sustained, and methodical
> change. We should not wait for or depend on technological breakthroughs
> (Glass 1993).
> Leading-edge productivity tools can play an important role in shortening
> development schedules, but it's good to keep their role in perspective. By
> themselves, they are neither necessary nor sufficient for achieving rapid
> development.

> Long-term, strategic advantages come from improvements in people,
> process, and product. Being up to date in productivity tools is part of the ante
> for staying in the game, but it won't give you a winning hand.
> If you deploy new tools in a haphazard way, the benefit that you receive'
> from them will wax and wane.


> When we see a new software tool, we can't help but find it mesmerizing. Who cares if it's practical! It's got 3-D scroll bars! And customizable menus! Look! It even   emulates Brief and
> vi and EMACS! New tools are seductive to software developers, and I believe that silver-bullet syndrome is an occupational hazard. We wouldn't be in this business if   we -weren't prone to believe that software tools could solve our problems.



> Software developers are bombarded with extrava- gant productivity claims—"Reduce your development time by a factor of 10!" (Or 100!! Or 1000!!!) Capers Jones   estimates that there have been false productivity claims in about 75 percent of the marketing materials published by CASE, language, methodology, and software tool   vendors in recent years.
> CASE tool vendors are the worst, followed by information engineering, RAD, 4GLs, and object-oriented methods (Jones 1994). On average, the tools for which silver-  bullet claims have been made produce no visible improvement or only marginal improvement. Some people have indeed been fooled.


> Object-oriented programming. Object-oriented technologies haven't panned
> out the way that people had hoped they would. One survey found that
> object-oriented projects had dropped from a 92 -percent success rate in 1991
> to a 66-percent success rate two years later. The explanation for the change
> was that object-oriented projects in 1991 were staffed with "champions" who
> might have been biased about their results or more highly skilled than av-
> erage. More recent projects have been staffed with typical developers who
> are more critical about the strengths and weaknesses of object-oriented prac-
> tices (Glass 1994b).



> Object-oriented programming is delivering major benefits in the area of re-
> usability, but the promised benefits in the areas of naturalness and ease of
> use have been disproved (Scholtz, et al. 1994). Object-oriented programming
> integrates many of the best ideas of the last 35 years of software develop-
> ment, but learning to use it well is difficult. It places more of a burden on
> the developer rather than less, and it should be viewed as an expert's tech-
> nology. When viewed that way, it is a valuable addition to the developer's
> toolbox.


William B. Frakes and Kyo Kang. Software Reuse Research: Status and Future. IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING, VOL. 31, NO. 7, JULY 2005:

> Currently, most reuse research focuses on creating and
> integrating adaptable components at development or at
> compile time. However, with the emergence of ubiquitous
> computing, reuse technologies that can support adaptation
> and reconfiguration of architectures and components at
> runtime are in demand. One implication of this development
> is that we somehow need to embed engineering
> know-how into code so it can be applied while an
> application is running. More research on self-adaptive
> software, reconfigurable context-sensitive software, and
> self-healing systems is needed.
